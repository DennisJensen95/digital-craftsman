### Description 

Full-stack software platform for data delivery of GIS
data from Danish water plants. A software stack
consisting of a Postgresql database connected with an
API on top of it. The API enabled a service to deliver
data to the Danish institution, LER, on request and a
front-end website for water plant clients.

### Some concepts I worked with in this position but not limited to:

* Data distribution service.
* Front-end user interface.
* Software architecture/stack.
