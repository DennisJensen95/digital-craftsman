# The Unwritten Rules of Dev/DevOps Team Survival: A Semi-Serious Guide 🤪

> **Disclaimer:** I'm not exactly a social butterfly with wings of charisma - more like a social caterpillar with occasional moments of flight 🦋

Ever wonder what you're actually signing up for when joining a dev team? Let me share what I've learned the hard way...

## 1. Constructive Communication (AKA "Use Your Words") 🗣️

We agree to communicate like adults, not like the passive-aggressive notes on the office fridge. This means:

* No cryptic one-word PR comments that leave everyone guessing 🤔
* Explaining WHY something is broken, not just THAT it's broken 🔥
* Actually reading messages before responding with "see my previous message" 👀

## 2. Aligning Goals (Or: Row The Same Direction, Please) 🚣

We're all in this digital boat together, so:

* Agreeing on what "done" means BEFORE we're "almost done" 🏁
* Remembering the user story isn't just a fairy tale we tell ourselves ✨
* Understanding that "making it work on my machine" isn't the finish line 💻

## 3. Agree to Disagree (Without Dying on That Hill) ⛰️

We promise to:

* Accept that tabs vs. spaces debates don't deserve scorched-earth tactics 🔥
* Remember that sometimes "good enough" beats "technically perfect but three weeks late" ⏰
* Let go of arguments that start with "but in my last company..." 🙄

## 4. Embracing Different Perspectives (It's Not a Bug, It's a Feature) 🧩

We acknowledge:

* Some people think better with diagrams, others with lists, others need to talk it out loud 🎭
* Your coding style might make me twitch, and mine might give you nightmares 😱
* The junior dev might actually have the best solution (shocking, I know) 🌱

## 5. The Context Commandment: Know Before You Criticize 🧠

We solemnly swear:

* To actually read the task description before saying "why didn't you..." 📋
* To not leave drive-by comments on code we don't understand the purpose of 🚗💨
* To ask "what problem are you solving?" before suggesting seventeen alternatives 🤯
* To remember that hindsight is 20/20, especially when reviewing code written during a 2AM production incident 🦉

## 6. The "Actually, It Works in Production" Principle 🤞

We solemnly swear:

* To not deploy on Fridays unless we REALLY hate our weekend plans 🏝️
* Documentation isn't just for "other people" - it's for "future you" who WILL forget everything 📝
* To stop saying "it should be a quick fix" (the cursed phrase of our profession) ⚡
