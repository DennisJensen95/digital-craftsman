*Date: Jan 2022 - Apr 2023*

### Role: Software Engineer

### Description

In his role as a Software Engineer, the consultant managed a software stack that, among other things, contained bridge software that integrated several IoT ecosystems together. This was realized using code generation tools, where he contributed to the development of a data model that drove code generation. As a result, the software was generated directly from the data model, making the development process incredibly fast.

Overall, the consultant was responsible for the application code for several Protocol Controllers and supporting applications. All these applications were executed as systemd applications on Raspberry Pi OS.
