# Unify IoT Gateway SDK

*Date: Jan 2022 - Apr 2023*

### Role: Lead Developer Operations Engineer

### Description

The consultant took on several developer roles at Silicon Labs, including the role of Lead DevOps Engineer. In this capacity, he was the architect behind several CI and CD pipelines. In addition to this, he played a key role in the development of the cloud infrastructure and worked intensively with AWS spot workers to drive CI/CD pipelines in Jenkins. This included a CD pipeline designed to deploy the SDK to an open-source repository and hosting of documentation.

The CI pipeline, among other things, handled the compilation of source code for various CPU architectures. This pipeline had seven parallel tracks, covering the generation of documentation using Sphinx and Doxygen, code coverage, compilation for x86 and arm architectures, memory leakage checks, and deployment to an RPi4 with accompanying integration tests.
