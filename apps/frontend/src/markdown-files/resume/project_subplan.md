# LER GML Data visualization

*Type: Personal project*

*Date: Feb 2023 - Present*

### Description

An application that is able to do geo-visualization of
underground infrastructure in Geographic Markup
Language data. This is to help people get easier
access, on the fly, to underground infrastructure
placement when working out in the field.

### Some concepts I worked with in this position but not limited to:

* Automatic release pipelines for internal releases and public releases in three formats. Android, iOS, and website.
* Fastlane deployments.
* App release managment.
* Test-driven development.
* Integration testing.
* Google Cloud and fly.io for infrastructure setup.
* API design and schemas.
