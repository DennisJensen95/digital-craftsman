### Description

A lightweight Quality Gate for Code Coverage in GitHub
actions. This quality gate is meant to make it easier for
legacy projects to increase code coverage by focusing
on code coverage on code changes and thresholding
that code coverage to a specific standard. This also fits
any other project but was originally thought out due to
projects having no code coverage and enforcing
developers to write tests.

### Some concepts I worked with in this position but not limited to:

* CI/CD quality gate.
* Version control management.
* Code coverage.
* GitHub actions.
* Test-driven development.
