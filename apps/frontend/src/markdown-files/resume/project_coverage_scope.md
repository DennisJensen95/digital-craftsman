### Description

The consultant has developed a lightweight quality gate for code coverage in
GitHub Actions. This quality gate was designed with the purpose of helping older
projects improve their code coverage. The quality gate focuses on the code
coverage of code changes and sets this coverage to a specific standard. This is
relevant for any project, but the idea originally arose as a tool to encourage
developers to write tests in projects without code coverage. The consultant uses
it extensively on all of his own projects.
