### Description

Digital Craftsman is the consultant's personal website, which serves as a
platform for his skills and articles he has written. The website is built with
Angular and a Rust-based backend. The consultant has integrated an LLM
model that answers questions about him based on his skills, as well as a Qdrant
vector database for semantic search. The website is hosted on the Fly.io cloud
service, and a CI/CD pipeline has been established for automatic deployment
and automated quality checks.
