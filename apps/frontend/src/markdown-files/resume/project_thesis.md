# Advanced Scheduling System for Autonomous Mobile Robot Fleet

*Type: Master thesis*

*Date: Aug 2021 - Jan 2022*

### Description

My thesis revolved around creating a scheduling
framework for robots from the company Mobile
Industrial Robots. This included a fully-fledged
software control framework incorporating
combinatorial optimization algorithms planning routes
for a fleet of robots. The main algorithm was AI based
on reinforcement learning and recurrent neural
networks. The models learned from simulators we
developed and learned how to schedule the robots for
optimal route planning.

### Some concepts I worked with in this position but not limited to:

* Software framework design and architecture.
* Combinatorial optimization algorithms.
* Neural networks.
* State of the Art research.
