# Unify IoT Gateway SDK

*Date: Jan 2022 - Apr 2023*

### Role: Frontend Software Engineer

### Description

The Unify SDK Gateway was implemented on an RPi4, functioning in a manner similar to a wireless router, but specifically designed for IoT devices. This led to the development of a control panel, which in practice was a website we hosted directly on the RPi4. Through this website, it was possible to visualize and control all the devices connected via the Unify SDK Gateway.

The website was developed in React with TypeScript and was executed as a systemd service on the RPi4. The consultant played a central role in the beginning of the project in this development process.
