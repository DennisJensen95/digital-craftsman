### Description

An application that calculates what one would pay for
electricity consumption with a fixed price versus a
variable price. The variable price is calculated with a
resolution of an hour. This information made me aware
that I was paying roughly 800kr too much a month on
fixed pricing.

### Some concepts I worked with in this position but not limited to:

* Computation algorithms.
* Test-driven development.
* REST api usage.
* API schemas.
