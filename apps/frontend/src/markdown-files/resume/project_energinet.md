### Description

The consultant developed an application that estimates electricity costs based
on the difference between a fixed price and a variable price. This calculation
was performed on an hourly basis, using data pulled directly from Energinet's
API. By using this tool, the consultant discovered that by using fixed pricing, he
paid about 800 kr more per month.
