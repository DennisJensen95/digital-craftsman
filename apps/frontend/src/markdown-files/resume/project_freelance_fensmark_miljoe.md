### Company: Fensmark Miljø

I have developed a complete solution integrating server infrastructure, backend, frontend, and edge devices to support a digital dashboard platform for visualizing the company's revenue and daily KPIs. The entire solution was built from the ground up and tailored to the company's specific needs.

As part of the solution, I set up a kiosk mode for edge devices and provisioned both the backend server and the operating system using Nix flakes, ensuring consistency, stability, and easy redeployment.

### My responsibilities/actions were

#### **Servers & Infrastructure:**

- Used Nix flakes to provision both the backend server and Linux servers, including OS images.
- Configured NGINX as a reverse proxy and for managing HTTPS certificates.
- Set up networking and DNS to connect system components.

#### **Backend:**

- Developed backend services in Rust for integration with e-conomic and Mobilplan APIs.
- Managed and structured data for dashboard visualization.

#### **Frontend:**

- Built the dashboard in Angular with TypeScript, visualizing KPIs and revenue data.
- Made microservices for interaction and business processes.

#### **Embedded Applications:**

- Designed and implemented a kiosk application for Raspberry Pi 4, functioning as edge devices.
- Configured kiosk mode using an operating system provisioned with Nix flakes for stability and easy maintenance.
