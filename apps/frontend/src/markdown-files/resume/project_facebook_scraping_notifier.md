### Description 

This service is a very simple web scraping application.
It scrapes a specific Facebook page to notify my
girlfriend when there is a cancellation for a hairdresser
she would like to get an appointment with. It runs on
infrastructure consisting of AWS EC2 instance as a
docker container, scraping the Facebook page every
minute and sending text messages to my girlfriend if
there is a cancellation.

### Some concepts I worked with in this position but not limited to:

* Notification service.
* AWS Cloud.
* Web scraping.
* Twilio text messaging.
