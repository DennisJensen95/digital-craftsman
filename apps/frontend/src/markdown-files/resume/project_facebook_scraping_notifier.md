### Description 

The consultant has designed a simple web scraping application. This service
scrapes data from a specific Facebook page to notify his partner when a
cancellation occurs at a sought-after hairdresser. It operates on a simple
infrastructure that uses an AWS EC2 instance running as a Docker container.
The application goes through the Facebook page every minute and automatically
sends an SMS message to the consultant's partner upon detecting a
cancellation.
