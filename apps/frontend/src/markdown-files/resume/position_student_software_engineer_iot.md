# Position: Student Software Engineer

*Date: May 2020 - Jan 2022*

### Company: Silicon Labs

[Silicon Labs](https://www.silabs.com/) is a leading provider of silicon, software, and solutions for a smarter, more connected world.

### Description

Before the consultant entered a full-time position at Silicon Labs, he had already gained valuable
experience in the company as a student assistant. Even in this part-time role, his responsibilities were the
same as those in his full-time position. His skills as a student assistant were recognized as being on par
with the full-time software engineers, meaning his areas of responsibility were in line with the other
developers. When he transitioned to the full-time position, he simply had more time to invest in the same
tasks.

The concepts and projects in the full-time position were the same ones the consultant worked on as a
student. Therefore, they are not repeated here.
