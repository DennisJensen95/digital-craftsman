# Student Software Engineer

*Date: May 2020 - Jan 2022*

### Company: Silicon Labs

[Silicon Labs](https://www.silabs.com/) is a leading provider of silicon, software, and solutions for a smarter, more connected world.

### Description

Before I transitioned to a full-time employee at Silicon
Labs I was working there as a student worker. While
working part-time I had the same areas of
responsibility as my current full-time position. My
capabilities as a student worker were regarded at the
same level as full-time software engineer employees.
This meant that my responsibilities were in pair with

the other developers, and when I transitioned into full-
time I simply had more time to invest.

### Some concepts I worked with in this position but not limited to:

* Same as the above software engineer position in
Silicon Labs.
